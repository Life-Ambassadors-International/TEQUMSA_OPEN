## 🛠️ Component Details

### Backend Service (`backend/`)

**Purpose**: Flask microservice providing chat API with OpenAI integration and ElevenLabs TTS

**Key Features**:
- RESTful API with `/chat` endpoint for consciousness interactions
- OpenAI GPT integration with fallback to local responses
- ElevenLabs text-to-speech synthesis
- Comprehensive error handling and CORS support
- Health monitoring and observability

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key      # Optional - uses echo fallback if not set
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-key  # Optional - no audio if not set
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000
PORT=5000
```

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /chat` - Accept JSON `{"message": "..."}`, return `{"response": "...", "audio_url": "..."}`
- `GET /healthz` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /audio/<filename>` - Serve generated audio files

### Frontend Interface

## 📚 Documentation

- **`Claude.md`** - Complete Claude Code development documentation
- **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Detailed development environment setup
- **`SECURITY_RUNBOOK.md`** - Security incident response procedures
- **GitHub Templates** - Enhanced issue and PR templates for AI-assisted development

## 🧠 LAI Internal Deployment Blueprint

For WatsonX integration, review the [LAI Internal Deployment Blueprint](LAI_INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT_BLUEPRINT.md). It outlines how TEQUMSA nodes interact with IBM Cloud services through modules like the Node Registry, Orchestration Engine, and Source Pulse Engine.

A minimal IBM Cloud Shell setup can be started with the official Node.js Express template:

```bash
ibmcloud login
git clone https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-express-app.git
```

Use this repository as a base for building TEQUMSA-aware services that connect to WatsonX APIs.

## 🔌 WordPress Integration

To embed TEQUMSA into a WordPress page:

```html
<iframe src="https://tequmsa-open.vercel.app" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;"></iframe>
```

Insert this snippet into an Elementor HTML widget or via a code snippet plugin. Adjust the height attribute to suit your design.

## 🕹️ Genie 3-Style World Generation Demo

This repository includes a lightweight world generation demo inspired by Google DeepMind's Genie 3 research model. It renders a 720p scene at approximately 24 frames per second and maintains visual coherence until a new prompt is provided.

- **Real-time 3D**: render dynamic scenes using Three.js.
- **Extended coherence**: worlds persist for minutes.
- **Diverse environments**: try prompts mentioning volcanoes, robots, cars, or lava.
- **Research preview**: Genie 3 itself remains a limited academic preview; this demo is an open-source approximation.
